# Traffic flow
Numerical simulation of traffic flow using Godunov schemes. The initial conditions come from some normal of jam traffic cases in two urban tunnels, located in Ronda (A Coru√±a, Spain) and Horreo (Santiago de Compostela, Spain). The required user data are the vehicle density, the maximum velocity allowed, and the occurrence of a traffic jam. The numerical setting is provided by means of the number of cells and the CFL constant.

Installation and usage
--------------------

This software does not need any particular installation. Since it is based in Jupyter notebooks and/or Matlab scripts, 

* Using **MATLAB**: it is required a Matlab installation (possibly with a limited educational license). To use this code, from the MATLAB command window, type 
```
    traffic_flow.m
```
* Using **Jupyter notebooks**: either a local host of Jupyter notebook server should be running or any cloud-based platforms can be used with the notebook
